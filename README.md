## Final Project Overview

We chose to select a stellar classification dataset that was compiled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which identified over 100,000 interstellar phenomena as either a star, galaxy, or quasar. The survey provided us with a wide array of observation data that included the object's alpha (right ascension angle), delta (declination angle), ultraviolet filter, green filter, red filter, infared filter, near infared filter, redshift, plate, the date the object was identified, and a variety of identification numbers relating to how the data was collected.

The group was highly interested in the topic of astronomy, and learning which features of an astronomical object were most important in classifying it as a star, galaxy, or quasar was highly interesting to all group members which is why we picked this comprehensive and detailed dataset. 

In this project we hope to learn how accurate our models are at predicting future objects with the same kind of data provided as stars, galaxies, or quasars. Additionally, our goal is to understand which variables are most important in determining/classifying objects in those three groups. 

## Communication Protocols
The group communicated through our Slack channel and met over Zoom to discuss the project.
